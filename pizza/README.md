In this work, I created a pizzeria website based on a prototype
<br>There were several requirements for the work that were fulfilled, it was mandatory to place a video on one of the pages, as well as place an interactive map, it was also necessary to get acquainted with the GD library, and to integrate MySQL database support.

<br>Map, videos also work
