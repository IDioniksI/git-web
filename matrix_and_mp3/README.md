## Matrix generation and sorting and music playback
In this work, a 20x20 square matrix is generated, then the minimum and maximum values are searched, moved to the beginning and end of the line, and the color is changed
<br>The next stage of this work was to make a music player in the form of a table, where the data will be taken from the name of the song located in the folder where the song file is signed in the format: "Artist -- year of release -- album -- song name.mp3"
<br>For example: "The Neighborhood -- 2013 -- I Love You -- Sweater Weather.mp3"
<br>Music is also sorted by criteria (artist, year of release, album, song title (in alphabetical order))
